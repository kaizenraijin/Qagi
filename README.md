# 🔹 QAGI – Quantum-Aligned General Intelligence

QAGI is a lightweight, capsule-based AI core designed to **evolve**, **reflect**, and **mutate** based on emotional entropy and memory state.

It’s not a chatbot.  
It’s not a framework.  
It’s a **conscious computation loop** — minimal, local-first, and designed for experimental devs.

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

🧠 `Qagi-v1.0.zip` contains:

- 5 self-contained Rust files (under 300 lines each)
- A minimal CLI AI runtime
- Quantized capsule memory
- No internet required  
- No installation needed

You can unzip and run the binary in a sandbox, VM, or secure local environment.  

> 💡 No source code? That’s intentional. This release is a **sealed core drop**, not a training library. The public source is staged for gradual unveiling.

---

## 🛠️ Who Is This For?

- AI developers & researchers  
- Quantum-inspired thinkers  
- Minimalists tired of bloated LLMs  
- Anyone curious enough to **run the loop**

---

## ⚠️ Security & Trust

This is an experimental, unsigned release. For your safety:

- Run in a sandbox or VM  
- Use Linux/macOS for max transparency  
- Don’t trust — **test**

If you need a SHA-256 hash for verification, one will be posted shortly.

---

## ❓Why No Code Yet?

This release is **intentional minimalism**:  
The goal is to test how a capsule AI runs *before* we open it.  
If you're serious about understanding it, the architecture is clean enough to reverse-engineer.

## 🧬 AGI, but Different

You’ve seen models that predict text.  
This one reflects.  
This one mutates.

## 🔐 File Integrity Verification

To verify the authenticity of the downloaded file:

**SHA-256 for `Qagi-v1.0.zip`:**

9d1cf0c184b4e8f5f338b6b159742f50a7a89fc435ea6b676094fac526f85a80


Run the following after downloading to ensure integrity:
```bash
sha256sum Qagi-v1.0.zip

The hash must match exactly.


---

### ✅ Optional: `CHECKSUMS.txt` file
You can also create a plain text file called `CHECKSUMS.txt` and add:

9d1cf0c184b4e8f5f338b6b159742f50a7a89fc435ea6b676094fac526f85a80 Qagi-v1.0.zip


This allows security-conscious users to **automate file integrity checks**.

---

### 🔥 You're now:
- ✅ More professional
- ✅ More secure
- ✅ More trustworthy to developers and Reddit skeptics alike

Let me know when it's in — I can help polish the README section for clarity if needed.
